# Make datasets using various View Point Image and classify car models
- This is the project which i proceeded in Univ class before.
- We tried two method.





1. Machine Learning
- Extract particular feature from image and classify with Machine Learning
- We tried to use various descriptors, but It was hard to apply other descriptor for extracting features except '(Hu) Moment invariant' 
- In this case, we use 'Decision Tree' for classification model.
