# Construct car model classifier with datasets which we made from various View Point Image.
- This is the project i proceeded in Univ class before.

## Goal
Implement model that can classify specific vehicle by increasing number of data through image distortion we generated.

## Method<br>
### 1. Machine Learning
- Extract particular feature from image and classify with Machine Learning
- We tried to use various descriptors, but It was hard to apply other descriptor for extracting features except '(Hu) Moment invariant' 
- In this case, we use 'Decision Tree' for classification model.

### 2. Deep Learning
- Trouble with selecting descriptors, we move on to Deep Learning.
